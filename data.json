I had a long discussion with Brad about this.  It's the same issue we faced when we freed lots of other databases: ITU, Patent, SEC to name a few.  People like to sit on the sidelines and do the armchair quarterback, but if you want to see this data liberated, somebody has to roll up their sleeves and do the dirty work.  Here's the deal: if you want to liberate an artificially protected database, somebody has to go do battle with MIS.  If your goal is 1000's of TLD's, the first thing you need to do is take the mystique out of it: put the database on-line properly using non-proprietary technologies and run it as a real service.  Once you've done that, you've punctured the balloon.  If Brad wants to see thousands/millions of TLD's, the first thing that has to happen is there needs to be a reference implementation.  That convinces ICANN and the convervative factions that it can be done and it gives the folks that want to do it a best current practices example. \"Death to ICANN\" is a nice battle cry, but what if son-of-ICANN is just as conservative?  Basically, Brad is doing the easy thing: painting a rosy picture of the future.  I agree with his rosy picture in some respects, but I also know that if we really believe that, it's going to take a heavy-duty team dedicated to seeing this through.  Talk's cheap: we're volunteering the next five years of our lives to make this a reality.  That's why Brad and Larry should stop preaching and see that they should be supporting us.  We need worldly philosophers, but we also need people in court rooms and machine rooms.

I can't predict what that is going to mean in 10-20 years.  If you really value stability of a particular alphanumeric sequence, then highly recommend you invest in something stable, such as one of the better-run ccTLDs (e.g., .nl).  2) I think you place too much weight in particular alphanumeric sequences. Your metadata is the important part, not the alphanumeric sequence under which the name resolves to an ip address.  More important than the name are your plans for making sure your data hangs around forever. I'd invest a *lot* of time in that problem.  So ... I know you work with lawyers, but unfortunately we're not going to give you a contract.  You have our word that you can continue to use web.resource.org.

I was talking about the future, not the past. All I could determine from  whois was that it appeared to be at risk of expiring within less than a  year. Since Swoogle reports web.resource.org as underpinning 6.77% of  all SW/RDF docs in its index, it seemed worth nudging the various  responsible parties. My email wasn't meant as a criticism, just a  friendly nudge since it's easy for these tasks and roles to get tangled up.                            If Carl was no longer interested in it, I'd be happy to pick it up. I do believe there's an email from him in the record promising to delegate web.resource.org to us in perpetuity.

Hope the above makes things clearer. Basically, please - between you,  somehow - do something that gives the wider community confidence that  the domain name underpinning CC URIs won't go back into the great  melting pot in the sky. I was pretty sure it's all in hand, ... but  thought it worth the risk of annoying you all.   FWIW I quite agree re changing namespace URIs. It really causes a lot of  hassle for consumer apps, so is only worth doing when there is a  substantial alteration in usage/meaning.   cheers,  Dan"}, {"Date": "Wed, 22 Aug 2007 09:28:34 -0700", "To": "\"Carl Malamud\" <xxxx@media.org>", "From": "\"Aaron Swartz\" <xx@aaronsw.com>", "Body": "Just wanted to send a note of congratulation for the great work you're doing at public.resource.org.

It is a full drain of gpo.gov ... they maintain a bunch of, believe it or not, WAIS databases.  They make that visible via the GPO Access interface which presents a WAISgate interface to the world. We went through that interface about 10 million times getting as many pdf docs as we can out of it.  The cool thing is we told GPO we were doing it and they didn't object.

I think that's probably the best bet. If a local government really tries to shut you down for publishing restaurant inspection scores, public interest lawyers will flock to defend you.

The relevant Supreme Court case here is Feist v.

Out of some 14 million prints, photographs and other visual materials at the Library of Congress, more than 3,000 photos from two of our most popular collections are being made available on our new Flickr page, to include only images for which no copyright restrictions are known to exist.  The real magic comes when the power of the Flickr community takes over. We want people to tag, comment and make notes on the images, just like any other Flickr photo, which will benefit not only the community but also the collections themselves. For instance, many photos are missing key caption information such as where the photo was taken and who is pictured. If such information is collected via Flickr members, it can potentially enhance the quality of the bibliographic records for the images.  We're also very excited that, as part of this pilot, Flickr has created a new publication model for publicly held photographic collections called \"The Commons.\" Flickr hopes?as do we?that the project will eventually capture the imagination and involvement of other public institutions, as well.  --~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~ You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Open  Government\" group.

We'd appreciate it if you would visit the OTA Archive today (http://fas.org/ota) and publicize it as widely as possible.\u00a0 FAS will be happy to host or link to any additional documents or commentary related to the OTA.\u00a0 Use the contact tab at the top of the site to send us your comments.    Thanks for your interest in the OTA.

On http://watchdog.net/static/.tmp/vtd/15151/docket.html you need to   adjust the URLs to be relative.   You have no metadata in the PDF docs.  At the very least, we need to   stamp in the following pieces of information:   1. the url of the doc you got (e.g., what is in your docket.html file) 2. the court: district court for the district of vermont 3. the office, which is on your docket.html file 4. the case number 5. the docket number (which is embedded inside of the case number) 5. the document number 6. the fact that it is public domain  (Tim, please chime in if I've forgot anything.)  Do you guys have/use exiftool?  http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/  I believe we want to do everything in the XMP headers.  Aaron, you   might be able to help me get this more precise.  A couple things I   think we need to set:   xmp:rights False xmp:license [url of creative commons public domain license]  xmp:contributor (name of downloader?) xmp:date (date on the document?) xmp:publisher (name of the court?)  Where I get lost is where and how to put the identifying information.    One project I work (archimedespalimpsest.org) shoves it all in the   description field as a bunch of name value pairs.  There is a proposal   Tom Bruce has advanced (see the open case list for details), but I   could never figure out from his spec where to shoehorn in things such   as the name of the office, or the case number.   It would be very nice if we all came up with a standard list of what   gets stamped where.  We can write that up as a precise guide for   others to follow and that would be very useful.   Note that none of this should slow you down from harvesting ... if you   keep everything collected as sets in a docket, we can go back and do   that part later as long as you keep a record of the urls you were at.

Aaron and I had lunch and spoke generally about his project,   focusing on the risks of bypassing licenses, and we discussed that   most works by fed agencies were noncopyrightable, as you know.  I   certainly did not suggest that USPS licenses were \"irrelevant.\"  It   was my understanding that Aaron was working with Berkman to get   actual legal advice on specific issues. Sigh.   In response to your mail, though, I have looked up the status of   USPS works and it appears that they are not considered a govt agency   and are therefore not covered by section 105.  That said, they can   only claim copyright in original works--not sure how that applies   here.  And it may be that the license is unenforceable, based on the   facts below, but we'd have to look at that more closely to assess.   Do you know what happened with Aaron and Berkman?

I purchased 3 USPS products and then sold them to Aaron.  He extracted the \"facts\" from those products and would like to distribute them.  I purposely did not check the copyright box on the order form (they have a checkbox that says \"I will make copies\" or \"I will not make copies\").  For one of the products, they enclosed a license form, but it was not a shrinkwrap.  The disks said nothing except \"no refund if the seal   is  broken.\"  The dvd itself says \"Copyright USPS 2005 all rights reserved.  This media contains unpublished, confidential, and proprietary information of the USPS.  By opening this software/ database package you are agreeing to become bound by the terms of   this  agreement, which includes the disclaimer of warranty.\"  Aaron says he has talked to Corynne about this:  ok, it just says it's a license. corynne@eff said that usps is a government agency, their stuff can't be copyrighted, so their licenses are irrelevant. this wasn't and isn't formal legal advice, of   course.   I've been pretty cautious about this.  I'm looking at the parsed data now from two perspectives:  1. Is it just \"facts\"? 2. Are the facts as presented different than the facts were on the original disk.  Corynne ... I was wondering how hard you looked at the \"USPS as government agency\" question?  That seems like the gating factor.

How's this:  USPS data is provided in a unique \"fixed-width ASCII\" format. We developed new tools for parsing this format and adapted them to the specific instances the Post Office provides. We convert encoded numbers to actual numbers, split up and clarify text, decode post-offfice-specific codes, and annotate each piece with what it does. In short, we convert a line like:  D91101Z200132998AS  GRANITE                     DR    0000000902000000 0998E055862CA      Z22427  to:  {   \"_type\": \"Five-Digit ZIP Detail\",   \"action_code\": \"ADD\",   \"addr_primary_hi\": \"0000000900\",   \"addr_primary_lo\": \"0000000899\",   \"addr_primary_odd_even\": \"BOTH\",   \"finance_no\": \"055862\",   \"prefd_lastline_ctyst_key\": \"Z22427\",   \"record_type\": \"STREET\",   \"state_abbrev\": \"CA\",   \"street_name\": \"GRANITE\",   \"street_post_dir\": \"\",   \"street_pre_dir\": \"\",   \"street_suffix\": \"DR\",   \"update_key\": \"Z200132997\",   \"urbanization_ctyst_key\": \"\",   \"zip\": \"91101\" }"}, {"Date": "Wed, 17 Sep 2008 13:54:35 -0700", "To": "\"Aaron Swartz\" <xx@aaronsw.com>", "From": "Carl Malamud <xxxx@media.org>", "Body": "fya.  http://public.resource.org/gpo.gov/index.html"}, {"Date": "Wed, 17 Sep 2008 17:14:33 -0400", "To": "\"Carl Malamud\" <xxxx@media.org>", "From": "\"Aaron Swartz\" <xx@aaronsw.com>", "Body": "awesome. that user-agent is hilarious.  have you thought about crawling GILS from gpo's wais? i've found it pretty useful in searching for government databases to foia. also, the congressional bio guide has been helpful.

Second, do you believe that for the districts you have, you are   complete?  Or are these incomplete snapshots?  How would one estimate   what portion of a district we have in that case?   I will be finished with my redaction death march sometime tomorrow.    I've personally redacted all the 32 districts, so I'll be able to   present the judicial conference with a dvd that lets them compare   clean to original copies, plus there is a ton of summary data I'll be   able to present.  After I'm done with redaction, it will take me a few   days to prepare the summary tables, burn the DVDs, write the letters,   and fedex the whole mess out.  After that is done, the data gets   released.   So, one final question ... do you want to do this with attribution or   do you want to be anonymous whistleblower?  The former is potentially   dangerous to you, but that is totally your call.  Let me know if you'd   like me to list the pros and cons of the two approaches.

It's important to note that the % here is the % of cases, whereas my 25% number is a % of data.

I hope he is quiet.

This is definitely a big project, but this is   certainly progress.   For the CFR, I'm now able to go from their broken sgml to well-  formed xml.  Now, I need to figure out how to lay it out as xhtml,   convert the eps files to png and pdf, and automate the laying it all   into svn so you can do diffs.

The audit shows that there may be a serious lack of compliance with   recent rules enacted by the Judicial Conference relating to   privacy.  Please note that the data showing privacy violations   cover both the period after the privacy rules of December 2007   became effective, as well as before that time, when local privacy   rules in most federal district courts contained the same   requirements. These data show that our general expectation that the adversary   system would be able to insure compliance with the privacy rules,   has turned out to be incorrect. I would suggest that the Administrative Office consider completing   the audit begun by public.resource.org to get a handle on this   problem.  The results might then be communicated to Chief Judges   and Clerks in individual districts where problems were identified,   so appropriate action could be taken to address the rule violations.

Carl  Rebooting .Gov  The Government Printing Office (GPO) should be used as the basis for a   \"revolution in governmental affairs\" that could achieve dramatic   results in 100 days, transforming the way citizens interact with their   government.  In the first 100 days, these 4 programs could be up and   running:   1. The Washington Bridge.  Immediately hook up all federal hearing   rooms in Washington, D.C. to the Internet to provide live, broadcast-  quality video as bulk data.  Services such as YouTube, CNN.Com, and   many others would process and present this information to the public.    The service would start immediately with the executive branch, but   would also be offered to Congress and the Judiciary as a service.   2. Open Source America's Operating System.  Immediately make available   in bulk key GPO \"products\" such as the Congressional Record, Federal   Register, U.S. Code, and many others. Create and release in bulk a   digital collection of all federal court cases, administrative   proceedings, and other primary legal materials.  Begin immediately   with historical materials, and then offer ongoing service to the   Judiciary to help them fix their PACER problems.   3. Create a .Gov Cloud.  Put several petabytes of disk and processors   in a facility to provide immediate outsourcing capability for the   executive branch.  For example, if an agency doesn't have access to   instant messaging, blogging services, or video servers, this cloud   could deploy resources quickly without an expensive procurement and   design process. Use this \"cloud computing\" as a way of educating the   agencies on a new way of conducting their computing business.   4. Go Beyond FOIA.  Submit legislation to the Congress that would   codify the principle of bulk access to government data as a   fundamental job of government.  This legislation would be based on the   \"8 principles of government data\" that was established by a group of   30 of the leading Internet practitioners in the field (e.g., Larry   Lessig, Tim O'Reilly).   The 100-day push could be used to create a real transformation over 4   years, achieving goals such as:   1. Fully digitizing all government information, including the Library   of Congress and the National Archives.   2. Changing the interaction between government and citizens from a one-  way stream to a two-way stream.  For example, citizens should be able   to participate in public proceedings, helping to suggest changes to   legislation or questions to witnesses before Congress.   3. Rebooting .Gov and making it one of the top 10 destinations on the   Internet.   A lot of groundwork has been done already on many of these steps.  For   example, the Washington Bridge plan was approved by the Bush   Administration's Public Printer and the technical details were vetted   by senior engineers from Cisco Systems, Google, and Sun Microsystems."}, {"Date": "Mon, 10 Nov 2008 14:27:09 -0800", "To": "Aaron Swartz <xx@aaronsw.com>", "From": "Carl Malamud <xxxx@media.org>", "Body": "Hi -  For link checkers, this is the commercial package I've used in the past:  http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/15878  I've also got this python thing to work:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/linkchecker/  Finally, this the w3c tool:  http://search.cpan.org/dist/W3C-LinkChecker/  In terms of data collection, here are just a few of things we might   want to look for:   1. are the links valid? 2. is the html valid?  (for a statistical subset of the pages, perhaps) 3. is the css valid? 4. are the pages accessible? (e.g., alt tags on images, etc.)  Those are all basically crawls, so have to be within the context of   the domain, the total number of pages in that \"area\", etc.   It seems that each \"audit\" has a scope (that business of agency and   departments, domain names, etc.) and a series of results within that   scope.  The trick is to be able to go beyond \"38 broken links for www.dhs.gov   which has 1,038 pages\" and keep this extensible so we can add new   audit techniques, either scripts or perhaps otherwise.   Some of the other things we might be interested in measuring:  1. is there ftp service?  rsync service? 2. nmap: what is the os of the target system or the target system(s)   and/or firewalls?  Is it \"current\"?  Are there \"bad\" open ports?  3. is there a privacy statement? 4. is the site usable?  Perhaps 4 designers all look at a site and   give it a grade plus some comments.  5. does a panel of experts feels the site meets the 8 principles?  Finally, I would think there is some kind of descriptive information   about the target: name of the agency, who is the chief privacy   officer, what is their address to write to with complaints, etc.   At the end of the day, I have a series of scripts that I run   periodically, which generate these various metrics.  Then, a reporting   script would go in and somehow create lists, rankings, and tables.    For example, for each subdirectory in my master directory, make a   table listing the name of the agency, the absolute number of bad   links, the percentage of bad links, the number of css errors, and the   panel of experts metric for usability.  Then, calculate some overall   ranking based on weighting of those individual metrics.   I think I'd start with the w3c tools and look and see if there are   alternatives that seem to be used and useful.   The primary goal here is to perform the audit.  But, the secondary   goal is to have the scripts/tools work in a way that other folks might   be able to use them on their own targets. If we can meet both goals,   that would be great.  If not, this has to be at least simple enough   that I can figure it out and run it.

That seems like a weird concern. First, the patent could be filed even if the data wasn't open. Second, I have trouble imagining anything that specific that anyone would patent.

I've   found two ways of calculating total annual costs: 1) Adding together ALL costs for \"Court Administration and Case   Management Systems\" and \"Electronic Public Access\" from that report.    This is a generous estimate, given that there are probably Court   Administration and Case Management Systems costs that are not PACER-  related.  Nevertheless, by this measure the costs are only about   44.30% of revenues (as stated in that report). 2) Using the number provided for \"The operational cost of the PSC,\"   which they cite as 4.52% of revenue in 2007: http://www.uscourts.gov/library/annualreports/2007/AR2007_page24.cfm This is probably a very low estimate, given that the costs of software   development, hosting, capital costs, and costs from the CM/ECF side of   things are probably not included.   So, I feel fairly safe in saying the costs are between 4.52 and 44.30   percent of revenue... meaning that they are making between a 127% and   2112% \"profit\".

I don't feel comfortable without a plan b.  it isn't right to   put 100% faith in one event.  you can hope for plan a, do everything   possible to make plan a happen, but it isn't right to not do anything.   more importantly, if you play to the media, you are no longer a story.  but, I hear you ... I will leave your name out of any decisions I   make.  And, I do intend to sit on my hands until at least noon   tomorrow, at which point I'm somewhat confident there is a chance that   Schwartz simply tells me he is running the story.  Either way, he and   I will be talking ... it is our aim to see this hit the copydesk by   noon.  He's at home nursing a kid just coming out of oral surgery,   I've got a bunch of other stuff, but we agreed to touch base early in   the day and then mid-day to see what the copy desk is doing.  And, if   he tells me it isn't going tomorrow, but the editor is ready to call   it something real, then I'm also happy to sit.   One reason John takes me seriously is that I have a real agenda that   is not press-driven.  If I am just sitting back and doing nothing, he   gets suspicious and thinks I'm playing to the gallery.  So, I tell him   honestly (every day) where I am and where I intend to take my agenda.    The last six weeks have not been about a nytimes piece, they have been   a day-to-day battle to get the district courts to behave.  I'm   confident that continuing to roll this out to the general public in   the next day or two is the right thing to do, and John knows we are   very, very close to that point.  For example, he knows my paper trail   went live, he knows WIRED has been chasing me, he saw the scribd stuff   go up.  The FBI and the jack-booted thugs are the lede, but the real   story is the courts have changed their policies ... that is the point   I am trying to reaffirm.

Met with two agents, Honeycut and her male   colleague.  He didn't have a card, they both had guns.  Met for an   hour.  \"We\" is \"me.\"   1. Went over my background doing government information, including   SEC, Patent, Federal Reserve Board, others. 2. went over the appeals court audit, letters to and from Rosenthal.    Left them copies.  3. Went over the GPO ssn issues we uncovered. 4. Went over the preliminary and final audits to AO on PACER, left   copies.  5. Went over the fact they ignored me, the appeals from Martin and DOJ. 6. When Ric Davis started talking FBI, I called DOJ. 7. Went over the December \"third and final notices to courts\", left   them copies, plus copies of the answers from judges, clerks 8. Went over the ny times piece (\"yes, it seemed substantially   accurate), the letter from lieberman, the letter to lieberman 9. Discussed PACER access in general, explained the cookie mechanism,   explained no IP address binding for a cookie, no decryption or   anything necessary. 10. Said we gave you an account to upload, once we heard there were   issues, just to be safe we cut off access.  Giving accounts if very   rare for us. 11. Explained Pacer recycling, how I encouraged people to use public   access program. 12. Said yes, you had contacted me and asked if I wanted more PACER   data.  We were surprised by how much data, but then you're a bright guy. 13. Decade-long experience working with you.  Never gave you any   money, with the one exception of the .gov audit, which you didn't do   and returened our check.  *NO* monetary incentives whatsoever. 14. I scrubbed all documentation on PACER, including web site pages,   PR, AO reports, etc for any indication whatsoever that this was a   prohibited activity.  Finding there was no indication whatsoever, we   did the audit process and released the data. 15. Appealed strongly for an opportunity to discuss these issues   directly with the AO, we had tried numerous times, they won't talk.    We're here to help.  We're here to help them fix their systems, even   if we disagree on policy goals (e.g., \"here's how you limit access to   a single site if that's what you want to do).  Stressed the valuable   public service we provided and the numerous letters of thanks we had   received. 16. Did *NOT* talk about how you got the data and why.  Did stress   that the process took many weeks and that nobody had contacted   anybody, no signs, no nothing of disapproval.  Conceded the volume   might have exceeded their expectations.  Did not specify where you   loaded your, but we did discuss in general the lack of IP binding and   the fact that anybody with the cookie can download.

That means in a   couple of days, Google will delete this information from their   cache.  However, other search engines such as Yahoo often take   longer to update their systems.   For the files that you have problems, you should look around the net   to see if other people have these files.  You can do that by opening   the files up, picking some names inside, and doing some searches.    You can also search for the file names.   Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.    Please be very clear that there are almost surely going to be other   copies of this public data that surfaces, so you're going to need to   keep an eye open for quite a while.

Until  now, USPTO\u2019s public data in bulk form has been provided solely as a  fee-based service. You can read more online from the USPTO\u2019s press  release and Google\u2019s public policy blog (text below).

Recently, we\u2019ve also worked on a number of public data search features, as well as experimental features like the Public Data Explorer.  There are many places to search for individual patents -- the US Patent and Trademark Office and Google Patent Search are two examples. But sometimes that\u2019s not enough. If you\u2019re trying to identify trends in innovation over time or analyze all the patents relevant to your invention, it helps to have all the patent data on hand. For example, the non-profit Cambia\u2019s PatentLens creates topical analyses of patent information, and they can only do this with a comprehensive data set. Others have experimented with a variety of online mashups of the data, such as an interactive map showing the most innovative states.The trouble is, that\u2019s a lot of information -- terabytes of it -- and in the past the only way to deliver that information was on DVDs and other physical media. The USPTO will ship them to you, and over the last decade Cambia alone has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this data. But with high-bandwidth connections on the rise, both the USPTO and Google think it\u2019s time to help people download the bulk data directly.That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to announce that the USPTO and Google are making this data available for free at http://www.google.com/googlebooks/uspto.html. This includes all granted patents and trademarks, and published applications -- with both full text and images. And in the future we will be making more data available including file histories and related data.We look forward to continuing to work with the USPTO and other public organizations to expand access to public data.

We're making a huge difference: in just the first week, we've gotten nearly 200,000 signatures and sent over 5000 calls to Congress. Amazing!  The bill's proponents are running scared. They've told journalists we should just trust the government and that our complaints are \"paralyzing the legislative process.\" Well, good! They originally wanted to ram this bill through committee in just a week -- now they've been forced to hold it until after the election.  But while we've slowed this bill down, we haven't stopped it. To do that, we're launching an all-out campaign to kill this bill. We'll be meeting with senators, organizing events in their districts, and pressuring them in the media.  Can you chip in $3 so we can keep the pressure on?  Every time we turn around, the bill's proponents start whispering to more members of Congress that we're blowing things out of proportion. They never mention the truth: that this bill would set up the first Internet censorship regime in the US. That's why we need our own advocates to respond and tell the public's side of the story. We've gotten awfully far without spending a dime, but now we need your help.  Click here to chip in $3 to help us kill this bill.  And in the meantime, please keep spreading the word. Email your friends, post it to your blog, share it on Facebook and Twitter, write your local paper, and put our flyer up around town. We've gotten almost 200,000 to sign the petition at DemandProgress.org. Let's see if we can make that 500,000 by the time Congress comes back to vote.

I just wanted to let you know of some new developments as far as PlainSite goes.  A while ago I stumbled across the PACER data that Aaron Swartz liberated in 2008 and was shocked to find it sitting only in compressed tarball format on Carl Malamud's servers. Princeton has done some interesting work with it under Ed Felten via RECAP, but basically the data isn't that much more accessible, at least by search engine, than it was three years ago.  As you may remember, FaceCash is no longer operational due to the California Money Transmission Act, but the codebase still works, and an integral part of the system for both money transmission and anti-fraud purposes is the ability to track legal entities separate from people. This basically means I have a decent database of companies, and I decided to put it to good use with PlainSite.  Aaron's PACER data is now available on PlainSite, in a way such that each case is cross-referenced with the laws that it's about, the lawyers representing the parties, the parties themselves (working on this, big companies are easier), the judges presiding, and the PDF documents in the docket. I also have just-now-working code that should allow users to add their own cases just by uploading the history file and summary from PACER.  We're also planning to link companies to PlainSite issues (problems and solutions), each other (lobbying groups and PACs with indecipherable names), donations, and politicians. I also think it would be neat to analyze how often judges rule for certain types of parties.  The URL is http://www.plainsite.org, but here are some example pages to give you an idea:  The FaceCash lawsuit: http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/case.html?id=716056 Judge Lloyd: http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/judge.html?id=126 Apple, Inc.: http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/index.html?id=3404 One of Microsoft's lawyers: http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/attorney.html?id=75749  If you have any thoughts, feedback would be great to hear.

We now have DOJ, DHS, and GPO visitors daily looking at case information (which is great, but also slightly ironic in the last case), in addition to many requests by private parties and law firms. I've attached a current graph of our traffic as seen by Google. Integrating better with the Internet Archive and RECAP so that we can get more current (post-2008) cases is still on the todo list.A few people have called or e-mailed asking for their cases to be removed from the internet; I've done my best to explain to them how difficult that is, and in a few cases (consistent with Carl's recommendation) I've added cases to our robots.txt file so that they aren't crawled (though of course pages that link to them still are, not sure there's much we can do there). We also put up a policy for people to reference here:\u00a0http://www.plainsite.org/contact/information.htmlThe fact that we're seeing so much usage of case data by government agencies made me wonder if it might be useful to researchers or the public at large to publish the server logs of who in the government is actually looking for and using this data. The requests come from a wide variety of agencies, and as a government transparency site I think it would be consistent with the site's goals. But it might also anger some bureaucrats, especially because search strings are in the logs--which is why they might be interesting. (Lawyers, is there any expectation of privacy when government employees search for public information on a free site? My gut says \"no,\" but I want to make sure...)Lots of companies and PACs are now indexed on the Flashlight page at http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight, along with their cases, lawyers, and political donations. Unfortunately, IRS and FEC provide their PAC donation data in totally different formats at different intervals, so for now it's just data from the IRS (which is in terrible shape between duplicates and misspellings).We haven't been as successful yet in the issue-based realm where we started, which might be because the site doesn't really offer a concrete way to ensure feedback to politicians. Along with some features specifically for legal professionals, that's on the todo list, too.Hope all is well. Feedback is always welcome.
